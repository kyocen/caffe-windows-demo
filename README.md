# caffe-windows-demo
this is a caffe demo for windows.
You can download this demo and run the exe to get the result.
I put all required dll in this demo,so if your computer has NVIDIA Gpu this demo will run in GPU.if you do not has a conmuter with NVIDIA
GPU,it will run in CPU.


Caution:
I do not upload the model file,Because the modle file is too big,so you can use your model,the deploy.prototxt can help you.
